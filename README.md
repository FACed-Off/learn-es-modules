# Modules

ES Modules are similar to Node's `require` syntax, but are a standardised part of the JS language.

[Modern browsers](https://caniuse.com/#search=modules) support modules loaded from a script tag with `type="module"`. This tells the browser that this JS code may load additional code from other files.

```html
<script type="module">
  import { add } from "./maths.js";

  add(1, 2);
</script>
```

Generally (for wider browser support) apps use a tool called a bundler to parse all the imports and "bundle" them into a single file that older browsers will understand. For ease of learning we won't be using a bundler.

## Module scope

Modules help with JavaScript's global variable problem: variables defined in one module are not accessible in another. This means you can have 100 variables named `x`, as long as they're all in different files.

The only way to use a value from another module is to explicitly export it from the module it's defined in, then import it where you want to use it.

## Exports

Files can have two types of exports: "default" and "named". A file can only have a single default export, but can have many named exports. This is conceptually similar to the difference between `module.exports = myFunction` and `module.exports = { myFunction }` in Node.

This is how you default export something:

```js
const a = 1;
export default a;
```

And this is how you named export something:

```js
const a = 1;
export { a };
```

You can only default export a single thing, but you can have as many named exports as you like:

```js
const a = 1;
const b = 2;
export { a, b };
```

You don't have to export things at the end of the file. You can do it inline:

```js
export const a = 1;
export const b = 2;
```

## Imports

There are also two kinds of imports: default and named. The way you import a value must match the way you exported it. A default-exported variable must be default-imported (and vice versa).

This is how you import something that was default-exported:

```js
// maths.js
const a = 1;
export default a;
```

```js
// index.js
import a from "./a.js";
console.log(a); // 1;
```

This is how you import named-exports:

```js
// maths.js
export const a = 1;
export const b = 2;
```

```js
// index.js
import { a } from "./a.js";
console.log(a); // 1;
```

You can import as many named-exports as you like on the same line:

```js
import { a, b } from "./a.js";
console.log(a, b); // 1 2
```

Import paths must be valid URIs. They can be local to your machine (`"./a.js"`) or on the web (`"https://cdn.pika.dev/lower-case@^2.0.1"`). This means you **must include the file extension** for local files. Node lets you ignore this, but it is mandatory in the browser.

**Important**: when you import a default-export you can call it whatever you want. You're effectively creating a new variable and assigning the default-export to it. In contrast named-exports have to imported with the correct nameâ€”otherwise JS would have no idea which export you wanted.

**Also important**: unlike Node's `require` ES Modules are not dynamic. This means you cannot put them inside your code and import things conditionally. You also cannot use a variable in an import path. Imports are static and should live at the top of a file before any other code.

## Challenge

1. Run `npm run dev` to start a live-reloading server
1. Split up the JS code in `workshop/index.js` into 3 files:
   - `math.js` containing the operator functions
   - `calculate.js` containing the `calculate` function
   - `index.js` containing the DOM event handlers
1. Change each file so they export and import everything they need to
1. Don't forget browsers only support imports inside a script tag with `type="module"
